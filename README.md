## Introduction
* This program prepares us for a career as a data analyst by helping us learn to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. We are able develop proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as we build a portfolio of projects to showcase in our job search.
* This repo contain only the courses and projects overview. Each of the projects are located in separate repositories.

## Courses
1. **Introduction to Data Analysis**:
Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

2. **Practical Statistics**:
Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

3. **Data Wrangling**:
Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.

4. **Data Visualization with Python**:
Learn to apply visualization principles to the data analysis process. Explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

## Projects
1. [**Explore Weather Trends**](https://github.com/weichong-ong/Weather_Trends_Exploration):
This project introduce us to the SQL and how to download data from a database. We analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where we live to overall global temperature trends.

2. [**Investigate a Dataset - Gapminder**](https://github.com/weichong-ong/Gapminder_World_Data_Analysis):
In this project, we choose one of Udacity’s curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. We complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing our findings.

3. [**Analyze A/B Experiment Results - E-commerce Website**](https://github.com/weichong-ong/E-commerce_Website_A-B_Test_Results_Analysis):
In this project, we are provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. We use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report our conclusions and recommendations in a report.

4. [**Wrangle and Analyze Data - Twitter account**](https://github.com/weichong-ong/Twitter_Account_Data_Wrangling):
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python, we gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. We document our wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.

5. **Communicate Data Findings**:
We use Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore a selected dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, we create a presentation that communicates our findings to others.
